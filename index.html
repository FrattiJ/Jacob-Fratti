            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello world! I am currently a student for the UCF Coding Bootcamp. I have been interested in learning to code for as long as I can remember, but I always thought it was something you had to be a genius to do. I recently had a freind who is currently a software engineer encourge me to try to learn how to do it; thus I began my journey. Since starting to leanr coding on my own it has been 8 months and I decided to try a structured bootcamp to give me some accountability and have a solidified deadline to completing my certificate. I hope to use this knowledge to jump into a new career feild and increase my earning potential. After earning my certificate in full stack development I would like to study game dev as a hobby and maybe look into cloud computing.</p>
